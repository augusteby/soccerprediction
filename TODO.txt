Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Plot time vs percentage_home_team_win --> should give info on whether time features are relevant or not
* Study correlation between features for future feature selection


Feature engineering:

* Add relevant time features [DONE]
* Add distance between HomeTeam and AwayTeam stadiums
* Add payroll for HomeTeam and AwayTeam [DONE]
* Add average home win odds
* Model how much I would have won/lost in average 
    * Create ID for all games [DONE]
    * Keep feature BbAvH = Betbrain average home win odds
    * For all predictions, look at real outcome, compute income/loss
    * Compute mean, max, min, std income/loss
    * For LogReg compute mean-max-min-std-INCOME vs Threshold(from 0.5 to 1)
* Find the model that maxmises the incomes

Modeling:
* Try with xgboost
