Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Plot time vs percentage_home_team_win --> should give info on whether time features are relevant or not [DONE]
* Study correlation between features for future feature selection

Feature selection:
* Select features based on their information gain vs the output


Feature engineering:

* Add relevant time features [DONE]
* Add distance between HomeTeam and AwayTeam stadiums [DONE]
* Add stadium capacity (assumption: the bigger the stadium, the more important
the support for home team: this can have an impact on the likelihood of 
winning for home team) [DONE]
* Add payroll for HomeTeam and AwayTeam [DONE]
* Add average home win odds
* Model how much I would have won/lost in average 
    * Create ID for all games [DONE]
    * Keep feature BbAvH = Betbrain average home win odds [DONE]
    * For all predictions, look at real outcome, compute income/loss [DONE]
    * Compute mean, max, min, std income/loss
    * For LogReg compute mean-max-min-std-INCOME vs Threshold(from 0.5 to 1)
* Find the model that maxmises the incomes

Modeling:
* Try with xgboost [DONE]
* Try stacking: RdmF, LogReg, xgboost [DONE]
* Try Neural Network --> use Grid Search
